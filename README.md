# Apple-Clone-React

Overview

This project is a responsive clone of the Apple website, built using React with a focus on component-based UI architecture. It replicates key pages such as Store, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Watch, AirPods, and more, utilizing reusable components for modularity and maintainability. The design leverages Tailwind CSS for styling and ensures responsiveness across mobile and desktop devices.

Features

Component-Based UI: Reusable components like Navbar, Hero, Footer, and product-specific components (iPhone, MacBook, Airpods, etc.).
Responsive Design: Mobile and desktop layouts, including an accordion-style footer for mobile views.
Tailwind CSS: Used for styling to achieve a clean and modern UI.
Modular Code: Structured for scalability and easy updates.
Pages: Includes sections for Store, Mac, iPhone, iPad, Watch, AirPods, and more.
